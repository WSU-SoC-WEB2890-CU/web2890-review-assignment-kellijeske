10 Changes:
1- Replaced the empty stars with full ones in the testimonials section. 
    - This avoids confusion with users thinking they all gave 0 stars in their reviews.

2- Replaced the empty rectangles from the Get Started section (looks like a mistake?) 
   so they have check marks instead. 
    - This encourages a positive outlook on the checklist items as if they are already 
     checked off as we speak! Also it makes it look better, not like a mistake.

3- Fixed the misalignment of the animated play button icon. The animation didn't match up to the icon.
       - This looks more aesthetically pleasing. The other way looked like bad coding.

4- Changed the look of the icon, lightened the primary color using bootstrap, and 
    created a hover affect with transition.
        - It made the button feel like it was actually being pressed when clicking it.

5- Changed Faq to FAQ in the navbar
    - This needed to be fixed so it looks like natural English. It is an acronym after all.

6- Made all the links actually work
    - A link should be linked to something, after all!

7- Changed the site title and icon (on the browser tab)
    - It looks more like a real website this way.

8- Changed the logo
    - I created/generated a cute animal with glasses from Adobe Illustrator because the site needed 
      something cute and friendly! 

9- Moved the waves a little bit (they were not aligned perfectly and had a small gap between it and the next section)
    - It looked bad otherwise. Changing this improved the website aesthetics.


10- Changed the font to Poppins
    - I think it looks a little better this way. I just wanted the Poppins font.


Note: I tried really hard to get the filter buttons to work, but I can't figure out 
      what I'm doing wrong in the Javascript. If you know why they don't work, feel free
      to let me know. If not, oh well. I can figure out a better implementation of that
      feature in a future project.
